<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s2">The General whipped her shoulders around 180 degrees, although she did not break her gaze with The Empress and allow her head to follow suit until a split second later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The corners of her mouth seemed to pull her chin toward her chest and her determined pupils became eclipsed by her open eyelids as her heavy boots propelled her toward the entrance of the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Third Eye of Sable pitched forward slightly to keep up with it’s Seer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The whir of it’s levitator could be heard by the guards momentarily as it sailed in front of their faces.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; “General!” The Empress stood from her seat behind the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sable did not alter the intensity of her march in any way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her arms straightened in front of her and her palms collided with the double doors. Despite their weight, they also did not affect her march.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her Third Eye just snuck through the crack before they slammed behind them.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; The silence left in the room from the sudden departure seemed to hang like a dense fog. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; “Empress, she means well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is representing her people just as her duty calls for.” &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; “Hush now Coda, this I am aware of.” Coda’s face pursed up as he gave an awkward fake-smile that said ‘Of course, your majesty.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m also not certain that I would not side with her people if I were in her place.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somehow, it felt as though the fog became thicker. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><span class="s3">&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s2">“Your Majesty…” </span><span class="s3">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s2">“Your Majesty?” She sighed and retreated to her chair. </span><span class="s3">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s2">“No, I am not changing position.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, I am not concerned about General Sable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She will carry out her orders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The offshore troops will report to the mainland, the transports will be refitted, and…” a sharp inhale, a long exasperated sigh, and a tilt of the head, “we will address the public and begin the evacuation process.” She took a hard gulp from her water glass and her swallow seemed to echo in the hall. “Dismissed.” </span><span class="s3">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s2">The officers slowly began rising from the table and gathering their things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone finally had the inclination to initiate small talk with his or her neighbor and a nervous buzz occupied the space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Empress, however, remained frozen in the previous stillness, her gaze tied to the doors of the hall, her hand clenching her water glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the buzz of an Eye behind her broke her trance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her head flipped to reflect her abrupt return to consciousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Seer Celia stood behind her. </span><span class="s3">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s2">“Empress.” She nodded. </span><span class="s3">&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
