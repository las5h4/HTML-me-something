		<h1>CHRONICLES OF SABLE</h1>
		<h2>Episode 1</h2>
		<p> The General whipped her shoulders around 180 degrees, although she did not break her gaze with The Empress and allow her head to follow suit until a split second later.  The corners of her mouth seemed to pull her chin toward her chest and her determined pupils became eclipsed by her open eyelids as her heavy boots propelled her toward the entrance of the hall.  The Third Eye of Sable pitched forward slightly to keep up with it’s Seer.  The whir of it’s levitator could be heard by the guards momentarily as it sailed in front of their faces. </p>
		<p> “General!” The Empress stood from her seat behind the table.  Sable did not alter the intensity of her march in any way.  Her arms straightened in front of her and her palms collided with the double doors. Despite their weight, they also did not affect her march.  Her Third Eye just snuck through the crack before they slammed behind them. </p>
		<p> The silence left in the room from the sudden departure seemed to hang like a dense fog. </p>
		<p> “Empress, she means well.  She is representing her people just as her duty calls for.” </p>
		<p> “Hush now Coda, this I am aware of.” Coda’s face pursed up as he gave an awkward fake-smile that said ‘Of course, your majesty.’  “I’m also not certain that I would not side with her people if I were in her place.”  Somehow, it felt as though the fog became thicker. </p>
		<p> “Your Majesty…” </p>
		<p> “No.” </p>
		<p> “Your Majesty?” She sighed and retreated to her chair. </p>
		<p> “No, I am not changing position.  No, I am not concerned about General Sable.  She will carry out her orders.  The offshore troops will report to the mainland, the transports will be refitted, and…” a sharp inhale, a long exasperated sigh, and a tilt of the head, “we will address the public and begin the evacuation process.” She took a hard gulp from her water glass and her swallow seemed to echo in the hall. “Dismissed.” </p>
		<p> The officers slowly began rising from the table and gathering their things.  Someone finally had the inclination to initiate small talk with his or her neighbor and a nervous buzz occupied the space.  The Empress, however, remained frozen in the previous stillness, her gaze tied to the doors of the hall, her hand clenching her water glass.  Only the buzz of an Eye behind her broke her trance.  Her head flipped to reflect her abrupt return to consciousness.  The Seer Celia stood behind her. </p>
		<p> “Empress.” She nodded. </p>
		<p> “Celia.  I did not know you had returned.” </p>
		<p> “I got back as the meeting was beginning.  I stood in the balcony and observed so as not to disrupt the agenda.” </p>
		<p> “So you heard the plans?” </p>
		<p> “Yes Empress.” </p>
		<p> “Do I have your support?” </p>
		<p> “Empress, we need to talk.” </p>
		<p> “I’m listening” </p>
		<p> “May I ask that we retreat to your office for this discussion?” </p>
		<p> The Empress stood and peered down into Celia’s eyes with a grave expression, understanding that this was vital information that she did not want to absorb. She motioned toward the door behind the table which lead directly to her workspace.  The Third Eye of Celia turned in exact synchronization with it’s Seer as she made in that direction.  The Empress took one more drink of water and sat the glass on the table as she followed.  The door closed behind them and the air tingled as they experienced the realm of privacy. </p>
		<p> “Report?” The Empress barked as she retreated behind the desk. </p>
		<p> “Sire, the storm front is moving much faster than it ever has before.  The models from the off-shore sensors are not even accurate as to the true intensity because the water level is so low in front of the storm that the sensors are not even collecting data from the upper atmosphere.  Based on the data we collected, Sanbor will be destroyed in in approximately 35 days.  It will be at the Capitol three days after that.” </p>
